            <h2 id="info-heading">Here's a time line of the rise and fall of Blockbuster Video:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> <p> <strong>1985:</strong> David Cook purchased a video store franchise in Dallas, Texas known as Video Works. However, the franchise did not allow him to decorate the store in a blue and yellow design, so he left and opened the first Blockbuster Video store. The store had thousands of VHS and Beta tapes.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>1987:</strong> Blockbuster won a court case against Nintendo that paved the way for video game rentals.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>1993:</strong> Fearing new technologies, Blockbuster invests in Viacom.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>1994:</strong> Blockbuster is bought by Viacom for $8.4 billion.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>1996:</strong> By this time, Blockbuster had acquired several competitors.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>1998:</strong> Blockbuster was offered an exclusive DVD rental deal from Warner Borthers that would allow them to rent out new movies before they were available for purchase.</p> </li>
              
              <li> <p> <strong>2000:</strong> The year 2000 was a pivital time for the the company. Blockbuster partnered with Enron to create a video-on-demand service that ultimately didn't work out.
